echoPin initialized to pin  9
beepPin initialized to pin 10
LED green1 initialized to pin 2
LED green2 initialized to pin 3
LED green3 initialized to pin 4
LED yellow1 initialized to pin 5
LED yellow2 initialized to pin 6
LED yellow3 initialized to pin 7
LED red1 initialized to pin 11

Initialize long distance and long duration
Define trigPin and beepPin as outputs
Define echoPin as an input
Define all 9 LEDâ€™s as outputs.
 
Loop
trigPin  turned on
Delay for 10 microseconds
trigPin turned off
 
 duration equals the time it takes for echoPin to receive the soundwave
distance in cm equals duration divided by 58.2  
 
If distance is less than 30 cm
            	9 LEDs turn on
            	Beeps at 900 hertz with 5 milliseconds between beeps
Else if distance is less than 60 cm
            	8 LEDs turn on
            	Beeps at 900 hertz with 10 milliseconds between beeps
Else if distance is less than 90 cm
            	7 LEDs turn on
            	Beeps at 900 hertz with 15 milliseconds between beeps
Else if distance is less than 120 cm
            	6 LEDs turn on
            	Beeps at 700 hertz with 20 milliseconds between beeps
Else if distance is less than 150 cm
            	5 LEDs turn on
            	Beeps at 700 hertz with 25 milliseconds between beeps
Else if distance is less than 180 cm
            	4 LEDs turn on
            	Beeps at 900 hertz with 30 milliseconds between beeps
Else if distance is less than 210 cm
            	3 LEDs turn on
            	Beeps at 500 hertz with 35 milliseconds between beeps
Else if distance is less than 240 cm
            	2 LEDs turn on
            	Beeps at 500 hertz with 40 milliseconds between beeps
Else if distance is less than or equal to 270 cm
            	1 LED turns on
            	Beeps at 500 hertz with 45 milliseconds between beeps
Else if distance is greater than 270 cm
            	All LEDs turn off
            	No beeps
delay 50 milliseconds
